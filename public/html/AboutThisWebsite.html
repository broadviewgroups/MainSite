				<p>I am a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and I wrote this website&#46; 
					Why&#63; Because I wanted to stay sober&#46; I wrote the 
					code while working through some HTML tutorials online&#46; I paid for the 
					URL&#44; I found a host&#44; I paid the hosting fees&#44; and the 
					site went online in late August of 2020&#46;
				</p>
				<p>This is not an official Broadview group website&#46; To be official&#44; 
					it would have to comply with the A&#46;A&#46; 
					Guideline MG&#45;18&#44; Internet&#46; If I were to put a link to the 
					guideline on this site&#44; it would violate some of the 
					rules of aa&#46;org&#46; Sorry about that&#33; There would have to be a 
					committee&#44; which would have to meet&#44; discuss&#44; and agree on content&#46;
					AND the group would have to pay the costs&#33;
				</p>
				<p>While I have tried to be truthful and accurate&#44; it behooves me to clarify&#58; 
					the opinions expressed on broadviewaa&#46;org are those of me&#44; 
					NOT Alcoholics Anonymous&#44; NOT the Phoenix Club&#44; 
					NOT Greater Seattle Intergroup&#44; and NOT the 
					Broadview AA Groups&#46; I have tried not to break anybody&#39;s anonymity&#46;
				</p>
				<p>If this website has helped anyone to find a meeting or stay sober or 
					has helped anyone in any way&#44; I give full credit to God&#46;
				</p>
				<p>If this website has done any harm to the unity of AA or has harmed any person or 
					entity in any way&#44; I take full responsibility&#46;
				</p>
				<p>Finally&#44; I would like to thank everyone who has contributed photographs and 
					posters&#44; made suggestions&#44; or informed me of errors&#46;
				</p>
				<p>Peace in Recovery&#33;</p>
